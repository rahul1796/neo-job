        People make organisations. But the right fit people make successful organizations. It’s time to question the challenges of attrition, productivity
        and efficiency. Is there a way corporates can ensure a systematic, talent-skill
        match on their hires? Pramaan’s employment framework powered by technology 
        platforms and job-skill research, helps classify the candidates into various
        skill proficiency categories. This is done so that corporates have access to
        only the right-fit candidates thereby lowering hiring costs, efforts and time.
        This scientifically match results increased workforce productivity and 
        decreased attrition rates.
